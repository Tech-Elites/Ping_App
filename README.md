# Ping

In todayâ€™s fast-growing world, social media is one of the biggest factors affecting life style of many, as everyone indulges in interacting with others on the internet. Most of the social media apps try to connect users digitally, where people like to chat, interact, and follow others to see their lifestyle. In the mist of virtualisation, people are heading towards a digital world where human interactions are close to none.

To overcome this dilemma, we aim to launch our application "Ping", which aims to increase human interaction in real life by finding companions for users based on the places they have visited. Users can register on the application, visit the places they like, and create a ping on their application. What this does is ping their companions portraying their visit and location with description, which may inspire and motivate them to travel to that location and ping back to the host sharing their story. This helps users stay fit, interact and make friends, and specially stay off screen time which is one of the hardest things to achieve.

Making new companions is not like any ordinary follow system. Users can ping-back other users who have already visited that place, sharing their memories, it will be up to the user who receives that ping-back to either accept it or discard it. If the user accepts that ping back they will be made companion with the user who sent it.
Users can also search for other users to view their previous public pings, and can interact with them by sending ping-backs.
